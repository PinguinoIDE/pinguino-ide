*** Pinguino EasyPack for win32, release note ***

First, to extract 7z archive , '7-Zip' has to be installed from here,
     http://www.7-zip.org/

Installation and start up Pinguno IDE:
  1. Using 7-Zip, extract 'Pinguino-X4-EasyPack-Win32-RevNNN-vNN-yyyy-mm.7z' to the arbitrary folder.
     (N,y,m is number or string) 
     It's highly recommended extracting this archive file to the folder 
     which name dose not have 'spaces or multibyte strings'.
  2. Move the x4-easy-revNNN folder to i.e. 'C:\x4-easy-revNNN'.
     (Because gpasm.exe can't recognize the long folder name.) 
  3. Execute x4-easy-revNNN\pinguino.exe,
     or
     x4-easy-revNNN\pinguino_start.bat

THAT'S ALL!!

But... :D
Prerequisite:
  1. If you encounter the message of not existing 'msvc*90.dll' in Windows,
     it has to be installed from here:
       vcredist_x86.exe (for win32),
         http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5582&WT.mc_id=MSCOM_EN_US_DLC_DETAILS_131Z4ENUS22004
     or as Python v2.6.6 includes 'msvc*90.dll' file , you may install the Python instead of vcredist_x86.exe
       form here,
         http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.6.6/python-2.6.6.msi
  2. On 8bit PICs, if you encounter the error message of "sdcpp can't find ..." during compilation,  
     add SDCC execution path to Windows environment variable PATH.
     i.e.
	 If you extract EasyPack to c:\x4-easy-revNNN (NNN is revision number),
	 add  c:\x4-easy-revNNN\win32\p8\bin to Windows environment variable PATH.
	 
	 General information about PATH setting: [ http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm ]
