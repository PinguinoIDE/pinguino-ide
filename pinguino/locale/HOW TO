1.- ABOUT THIS DOCUMENT AND THIS TRANSLATION PACK
===============================================================================
This document and the internationalization code for Pinguino IDE, was
created by Pinguino community members.  Feel free to contact us in our forum: 
forum.pinguino.cc in the General - Suggestions for Improvement section.

This document includes general information about how to install this translation
pack and how to modify or update the built-in translation files.


2.- LANGUAGE SUPPORT
===============================================================================
In this Translation Directory we have included translation files for these 
languages:

	(da) Detush
	(en) English
	(es) Spanish
	(fr) French
	(it) Italian
	(pt) Portuguese
	(pt_BR) Portuguese BRAZIL

This is an initial selection, based on the list of countries of Pinguino users
and activist around the world, refered by J.P.Mandon at HackingLab's Blog.

Support for more languages can be easily incorporated, either edited by
developers themselves or by a request to us to develop and deploy another 
language with new versions of Pinguino IDE.


3.- THE "locale" DIRECTORY STRUCTURE AND CONTENT
===============================================================================
In the pinguino IDE directory, you can see this directory structure:

	.
	├── HOW TO
	├── translate.py	
	├── de
	│   └── LC_MESSAGES
	│       ├── pinguino.mo
	│       └── pinguino.po
	├── en
	│   └── LC_MESSAGES
	│       ├── pinguino.mo
	│       └── pinguino.po
	├── es
	│   └── LC_MESSAGES
	│       ├── pinguino.mo
	│       └── pinguino.po
	├── fr
	│   └── LC_MESSAGES
	│       ├── pinguino.mo
	│       └── pinguino.po
	├── it
	│   └── LC_MESSAGES
	│       ├── pinguino.mo
	│       └── pinguino.po
	├── pt
	│   └── LC_MESSAGES
	│       ├── pinguino.mo
	│       └── pinguino.po
	├── pt_BR
	│   └── LC_MESSAGES
	│       ├── pinguino.mo
	│       └── pinguino.po
	└── sources
	    ├── dock_files.py
	    ├── editeur.py
	    ├── framesX3.py
	    ├── general.py
	    └── pinguino.py

Each directory language is indentified by two-letter codes from the ISO-639-1,
Codes for the representation of names of languages, international standard.

The ".po" files (PORTABLE Objects) are TEXT files that also contain the
original string/translation pairs.  These are used by developers to edit the 
translated words and phrases needed to translate the application.  They are 
then compiled to ".mo" files (see below).

The ".mo" files (MACHINE Objects) are BINARY files that contain the
original string/translation pairs. These are used by the pygettext code, 
included in the new pinguino.py file, to translate the application at run time.


4.- Instructions to Modify or Update the translation files
===============================================================================
Modifying or updating the portable objects (*.po) and machine objects (*.mo) 
files is very easy and simple to do.

You only need to do these steps to modify or update your language files:

	A) Download/Install "Poedit" (Easy to use GUI tool to edit po/mo files).
	B) Execute translate.py
	C) Select language
	D) Edit the the Poedit SearchPath.
	E) Edit the translation values then save, poedit will re-generate the .mo file
		If a particular original string does not need to be translated, then leave
		the translation value blank.
	F) Execute your pinguino IDE !! you can see your changes

Please, don't forget to send us your modified files (.po/.mo) to include them
in the new versions of PinguinoIDE.  You can send it to the mailing list 
https://groups.google.com/group/pinguinocard, you can hang it on the 
forum specific to your language http://forum.pinguino.cc/forumdisplay.php?fid=23
or edit the page into the wiki: wiki.pinguino.cc/index.php?title=Category:Locale.

Thanks a lot !!
