/*
 * USB Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)  (Header File)
 *
 * This file abstracts the hardware interface.  The USB stack firmware can be
 * compiled to work on different USB microcontrollers, such as PIC18 and PIC24.
 * The USB related special function registers and bit names are generally very
 * similar between the device families, but small differences in naming exist.
 *
 * In order to make the same set of firmware work accross the device families,
 * when modifying SFR contents, a slightly abstracted name is used, which is
 * then "mapped" to the appropriate real name in the usb_hal_picxx.h header.
 *
 * Make sure to include the correct version of the usb_hal_picxx.h file for
 * the microcontroller family which will be used.
