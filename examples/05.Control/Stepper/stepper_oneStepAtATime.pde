/* 
	Stepper Motor Control - one step at a time

	This program drives a unipolar or bipolar stepper motor. 
	The motor is attached to digital pins 0 - 3 of the Pinguino.

	The motor will step one step at a time, very slowly.  You can use this to
	test that you've got the four wires of your stepper wired to the correct
	pins. If wired correctly, all steps should be in the same direction.

	Use this also to count the number of steps per revolution of your motor,
	if you don't know it.  Then plug that number into the oneRevolution
	example to see if you got it right.
