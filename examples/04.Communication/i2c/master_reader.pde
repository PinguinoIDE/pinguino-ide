Description:
This is the master reader program
associated to "wire_st.pde" the slave transmitter program
available speeds are 100, 400, 1000 Khz coded respectively 1, 4, 10 in Wire.begin
Upload each .hex
Open a tty terminal 9600 bds connected to the master to show the received message
If a terminal is already opened shut it and restart it
Start the slave (even if it starts at the end of uploading) before the master
Tested with a Pinguino 18f4550 connected to another Pinguino 18f4550 (as master)
thru SDA and SCL lines (pins RB0, RB1). Each of these lines is connected to +5V 
thru a 2.2KOhm resistor.
